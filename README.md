# blendersupport
support business for blender
This project represents the frontend for a bounty-based support business that provides business to business support for production/game companies. Essentially companies that use blender in production can contract with our company for support. They can upload issues they are having with blender, for example a characters arm is twitching during a specific cutscene, and blender gurus that work for blendersupport can try and solve these issues. If the issue is solved, our blender professionals will bill the company by the hour for the time it took to solve the bug. Since the value of my company is in the knowledge and expertise of the employees, it isn't super necessary to have a restrictive license that protects the source code of our website. As a result I chose the MIT license.
